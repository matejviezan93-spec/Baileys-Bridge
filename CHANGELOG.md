# 🧬 Symbióza Bridge — v1.0.0 (MVP Stable Loop)

> **Release date:** 2025-11-01  
> **Status:** Stable / First Public Milestone  
> **Tag:** `v1.0.0`  
> **Modules:** bridge-ai · bridge-worker · bridge-sql · bridge-redis · bridge-monitoring · bridge-core-infra · baileys-api

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- First fully integrated **Redis ↔ AI ↔ Worker ↔ API ↔ SQL ↔ Monitoring** bridge.
- Complete orchestration via `docker compose up --build`.
- Symbiotic multi-module structure, each deployed and versioned independently.
- Implements **MVP loop** for real-time AI message handling and observability.

---

## 🧠 bridge-ai
- Implemented FastAPI server with Redis Pub/Sub listener (`ai_request` → `ai_response`).
- Added `uvicorn` launch, health endpoint `/healthz`.
- Connected to Redis service via `aioredis`.

---

## ⚙️ bridge-worker
- Node worker listening to `ai_request`, publishing `ai_response`.
- Uses Redis client (`@redis/client`) with async publishing.
- Added `package.json` and Dockerfile (build with Node 18 Alpine).

---

## 🔗 baileys-api
- Added FastAPI API gateway exposing bridge endpoints.
- Containerized with Uvicorn and Redis environment variables.

---

## 💾 bridge-sql
- PostgreSQL 15 service integrated with default DB (`bridge`).
- Environment variables `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`.
- Persistent volume and clean startup.

---

## 🧱 bridge-core-infra
- Contains shared network and infra definitions.
- Provides base infrastructure for bridge deployment.

---

## 🧩 bridge-redis
- Runs Redis 8.2 with modules (RedisJSON, RedisSearch, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom).
- Configured as central message bus for AI and Worker services.

---

## 📊 bridge-monitoring
- Prometheus and Grafana integration.
- Simplified configs, removed provisioning spam.
- Default dashboard available at `:3000`.

---

## 🧬 Architecture notes
- Multi-module design enables independent updates.
- Unified Docker network `bridge_net`.
- Each module has its own CI/CD and GitHub repo.

---

## 🧾 Next milestone (v1.1.0)
- ✅ Add Redis queue and metrics pipeline.  
- ✅ Implement pytest / SuperTest for API validation.  
- ✅ Add Grafana healthcheck dashboard.  
- ✅ Bridge test endpoint (`/bridge/test`).
