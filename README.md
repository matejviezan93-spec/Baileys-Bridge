## Repository Management

### Branch Cleanup

To maintain a clean repository, you can delete all branches except `main`. See the [Branch Cleanup Guide](docs/BRANCH_CLEANUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick start:**
- Run the GitHub Actions workflow: Go to Actions → Cleanup Branches → Run workflow
- Or use the script: `./scripts/cleanup-branches.sh`
