# Baileys-Bridge Core Orchestrator

The `core/` directory contains shared infrastructure and automation assets that power the Baileys-Bridge hybrid Symbióza architecture.

- `infra/` – Terraform and infrastructure-as-code definitions that provision the shared platform.
- `ci/` – Reusable CI/CD workflows and shared pipeline logic for downstream modules.
- `env/` – Shared environment templates, secrets manifests, and configuration overlays.

Each subdirectory owns its own README with additional details and onboarding notes.
