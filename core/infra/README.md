# Core Infrastructure

This directory houses Terraform modules and configuration for provisioning the Baileys-Bridge control plane on DigitalOcean. The resources created here are intended to host and orchestrate the modular subprojects maintained in `modules/`.

See `provider.tf`, `main.tf`, and supporting files for implementation specifics.
